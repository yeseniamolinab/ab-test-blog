     * The useEffect cleanup is a function in the useEffect Hook that allows us to tidy up our code before our component unmounts. 
     * When our code runs and reruns for every render, useEffect also cleans up after itself using the cleanup function.
     * React performs the cleanup when the component unmounts. Howeverâ€¦ effects run for every render and not just once.
     * This is why React also cleans up effects from the previous render before running the effects next time.
     * Source: https://blog.logrocket.com/understanding-react-useeffect-cleanup-function/
     * 
     * In this piece of code, the isMounted variable is set to false when the component is unmount to avoid an attepmt to update state on an unmounted component.
